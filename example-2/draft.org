* Example 2

** Learning objectives

- To understand the assumptions of linear regression and be able to understand
  when it is /not/ appropriate.
  + The matter of how to resolve the data not conforming to the assumptions is
    left as a subsequent problem.
  + There will be examples of data sets where it both is and is not appropriate
    to use simple linear regression.
- How to interpret the results of simple linear regression when it /is/
  appropriate to use.

** Outline

*** Review how to compute the estimate for a simple linear regression

- *10 minutes + 5 minutes, 1 questions*
- Get them to write a function to compute the estimate
- This is pretty much just writing a wrapper around the =statsmodels= function
  for least squares regression.
  
*** Review the assumptions of a simple linear regression

- *20 minutes + 15 minutes, 2 questions*
- Review the basic assumptions of linear regression and why these are important,
  noting that only some of them can be observed from the data.
  + linearity
  + constant variance
  + normality
  + independence of errors
  + no error in the measurement of the covariate
  + the covariate is not invariant
- Get them to visualise the data and model fit 

*** *BREAK*

*** Review how to summarise the results of a simple linear regression

- *15 minutes + 10 minutes, 2 questions*
- Get them to write a function to compute model summary statistics which are
  useful for assessing model fit.
  + correlation coefficient
  + residual standard error
  + coefficient of determination
- Get them to understand the different between a significant effect and a
  substantial effect.
  
*** Examples of data sets which need to be checked for violation of assumptions

- *25 minutes + 10 minutes, 6 questions*
- Get them to work though data sets working out in what ways they violate the
  assumptions of linear regression and to estimate the parameters for the couple
  of examples where they follow the assumptions.

*** Example of linear regression with multiple covariates

- Diagnose an example where there is very strong correlation between two of the
  covariates.
