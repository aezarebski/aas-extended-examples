    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will learn how to use regression to study the factors that affect the number of pats cats will recieve. This will start with a visual inspection of the data, followed by the development of a linear model to explain the data. Along the way we will answer a few questions such as: does coat colour influence the number of pats, is a long coat better than a short coat, and how important is the volume of a meow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Specifying regression models\n",
    "\n",
    "A very popular way to describe regression models is with \"formulae\" as popularised by R. The [R documentation on formulae](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.html#Formulae-for-statistical-models) is a good place to learn how to use these properly. For example, here is the syntax we will use today,\n",
    "\n",
    "- `y ~ x1 + x2` will make a linear model with the predictors $x_1$ and $x_2$.\n",
    "- `y ~ x1 * x2` includes the terms $x_1 + x_2 + x_1x_2$\n",
    "- `y ~ x1 : x2` includes *just* the interaction term $x_1x_2$\n",
    "- `y ~ C(x)` specifies that $x$ is a catagorical variable **NOTE** this is not necessary in R."

    "## Helping cats get more pats\n",
    "\n",
    "Professor Mittens in interested in helping cats optimise the number of pats they can get. To learn more about this, he has interviewed 1000 cats and taken measurements of their behaviour and appearance. The data in `cat-pats.csv` contains measurments of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `time_outdoors` is the number of hours that the cat is out of their primary dwelling,\n",
    "- `coat_colour` is either tortoiseshell, white, or \"other\" encoded as integers 1, 2, and 3 respectively,\n",
    "- `weight` is the weight of the cat in kilograms,\n",
    "- `height` is their height in centimeters,\n",
    "- `loudness` is a measure of how loud their meow is, the units are not known,\n",
    "- `whisker_length` is the length of their whiskers in centimeters,\n",
    "- `is_longhaired` is a Boolean variable equal to 1 if the cat is of a longhaired breed and 0 if it is of a shorthaired breed,\n",
    "- `coat_length` is the length of their fur in centimeters,\n",
    "- and `num_pats` is the number of pats they received on the day they were interviewed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable we are interested in explaining is `num_pats`. Although this is a discrete variable, we will ignore this aspect of the data and consider it as a continuous value. This is a useful simplifying assumption, as you learn more about regression, in particular generalized linear models, you will see additional ways to handle this. For this example, you can consider it a continuous variable though.\n",
    "\n",
    "The types of questions that Professor Mittens is interested in answering are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Do any of the variables correlate with the number of pats that the cats recieve?\n",
    "2. Under a naive model, how much of the variability in pats can they explain? Do all the variables need to be included?\n",
    "3. Does the coat colour matter?\n",
    "4. Among short-haired breeds they say longer hair is better, among long-haired breeds they say short hair is better, who is correct?\n",
    "5. **If a cat can choose to spend more time outdoors, or practise meowing louder, which will get them more pats?**"
