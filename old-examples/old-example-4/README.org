* Example 4

This example is a BOGO! See the notebooks with =grades= in the names to help
Professor mittens understand the relationship between studying and exam grades.
If you still want more statistical action, you can see the notebooks with
=weight= in the title to help Professor Mittens interrogate some time series.

book]].

** Using =lme4=

The [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/vignettes/lmer.pdf][vignette for =lme4=]] is useful, it has been peer reviewed for publication in
J. Stat. Softw. In particular, Table 2 of that document might serve as a useful
reference for the syntax used in the formula.
