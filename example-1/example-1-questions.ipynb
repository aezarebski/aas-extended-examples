    "In this lab we will look at the binomial distribution, central limit theorem, and analyse two data sets collected by [Professor Mittens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mittens_(cat)) helping him interrogate the bais in the results of coin flips. Some of the questions are open-ended by design. Partial solutions will be distributed at the end of the session. The imports below are used in the provided solutions, consider these suggestions, not constraints. The answers use `altair` but you can use any plotting library you are comfortable with."

    "\n",
    "Bernoulli and binomial random variables are the typical way to represent the outcome of coin flips. Below we consider estimates of the probability of heads based on a known number of successes in a given number of trials and also a confidence interval (CI) for this based on the Wald method will be given.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $X$ be a binomial random variable (RV) which results from the number of heads when a coin is flipped $n$ times and the probability of coming up heads is $p$. For the time being we will assume that $n$ is know. The expected value of $X$ is $np$. So a simple way to estimate $p$ is to divide the number of heads, $X$, by the number of flips, $n$. This gives the estimate \n",

    "It turns out that this is a very sensible thing to do. The resulting estimate is called the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of $p$. It is also the result that one obtains via [the method of moments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_moments_(statistics)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an estimator though, we want to know how confident we are in the estimate it produces. Here we will use the Wald method to get the $95\\%$ CI. It is a very simple method but is acceptable when we have a fair bit of data. The estimated standard error of $\\hat{p}$ is $\\sqrt{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})/n}$, so the Wald CI is given by\n",
