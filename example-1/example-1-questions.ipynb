    "of values we are confident the \\\"true\\\" probability of heads lies\n",
    "within.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binomial random variables can be used to model the number of times a\n",
    "coin comes up heads when flipped $n$ times. Let $X$ be a binomial random\n",
    "variable (RV) representing the number of heads that are observed when a\n",
    "coin is flipped $n$ times and the probability of coming up heads is $p$.\n",
