#+title: Logistic regression with Professor Mittens

We will perform the last part of this analysis in R to make use of the wider
range of statistical packages available. Much of the code should seem familiar
after working with =pandas= and =statsmodels= (the main exception being that
assignment is declared with an arrow: =<-=)

Please note that some of the material in this document goes beyond what you have
seen in the lectures but has been included to give you some more perspective for
when you are doing the summative. Further details can be found in the text book:
Chapter 14 of Fox (2015). At the time of writing, getting C++ code to work
properly from the R kernel in a Jupyter notebook is challenging so this analysis
is given as a static file instead.

** Effect displays

The interpretation of the coefficients of GLM models (of which logistic
regression is a special case) is difficult. An /effect display/ is a figure that
assists in interpreting the fit of the model. In the case of logistic
regression, it shows the probability of membership to different response values
in response to changes in one of the predictors while keeping the remaining ones
at values that are in some way "typical". For the precise mechanics of how these
figures are generated, you are recommended to read the [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/effects/index.html][documentation for the
=effects= package]].

The "typical" measure that is used by default is the mean, but please keep in
mind that if you have bi-modal or highly correlated co-variates this could lead
to a typical value that is in fact highly atypical.

* Packages

#+begin_src R :tangle example-3-answers-b.R
library(nnet)
library(MASS)
library(effects)
#+end_src

- the =nnet= package provides the function =multinom= for multinomial logistic
  regression,
- the =MASS= package provides =polr= for proportional odds logistic regression
  which can be used for ordinal logistic regression as described in Chapter 14
  of Fox,
- the =effects= package provides functions for interrogating the estimated
  parameters of a GLM.

* Reading in the data

To make sure that R interprets the survey data correctly we need to coerce some
of the variables to Booleans and enumerations (factors) as they are represented
as integers in the CSV.

#+begin_src R :tangle example-3-answers-b.R
data_df <- read.csv("cat-opinions.csv")
data_df$work_from_home <- as.logical(data_df$work_from_home)
data_df$fifth_generation <- as.logical(data_df$fifth_generation)
data_df$support_lockdown <- factor(data_df$support_lockdown,
                                   levels = 0:4,
                                   ordered = TRUE)
#+end_src

* Logistic regression

This is the same as the material already covered in the notebook,
=example-3-X.ipynb=. We repeat it here as a reference for how to do this sort of
work in R.

** Fitting the model

The =glm= function does not require an additional package to be loaded. The
function call is pretty much the same as with =statsmodels= in python. Note that
we need to specify that the data comes from a binomial distribution because
otherwise it will assume it comes from a Guassian distribution.

#+begin_src R :tangle example-3-answers-b.R
binary_df <- data_df[data_df$will_vaccinate != 0, ]
binary_df$will_vaccinate <- 0.5 * (binary_df$will_vaccinate + 1)
binary_logistic <- glm(will_vaccinate ~ work_from_home + whisker_length + trust_in_government + fifth_generation,
  data = binary_df,
  family = binomial
)
#+end_src

** Interrogating the fit

The =summary= function plays a similar role to the =summary= method of
=statsmodels=.

#+begin_src R :tangle example-3-answers-b.R
print(summary(binary_logistic))
#+end_src

#+begin_src 
Call:
glm(formula = will_vaccinate ~ work_from_home + whisker_length + 
    trust_in_government + fifth_generation, family = binomial, 
    data = binary_df)

* Multinomial logistic regression

** Fitting the model

The =nnet= package provides the =multinom= function which otherwise has behaves
similar to the analogous function from =statsmodels=.

#+begin_src R :tangle example-3-answers-b.R
multi_logistic <- multinom(will_vaccinate ~ work_from_home + whisker_length + trust_in_government + fifth_generation,
                           data = data_df)
#+end_src

** Interrogating the fit

#+begin_src R :tangle example-3-answers-b.R
print(summary(multi_logistic))
#+end_src

#+begin_src

multinom(formula = will_vaccinate ~ work_from_home + whisker_length + 
    trust_in_government + fifth_generation, data = data_df)

* Ordinal logistic regression: proportional odds

This material goes beyond what has been covered in lectures and so is primarily
included for those who are interested.

** Fitting the model

The =MASS= package provides =polr= for proportional odds logistic regression
which performs ordinal logistic regression.

#+begin_src R :tangle example-3-answers-b.R
prop_odds_logistic <- polr(support_lockdown ~ work_from_home + whisker_length + trust_in_government + fifth_generation,
                           data = data_df)
#+end_src

** Interrogating the fit

In ordinal logistic regression you need to estimate the intercept values,
denoted \(\alpha\) in Fox (2015), in addition to the coefficients of the model.
Note that now we only have a single set of coefficients, unlike in the case of
nominal logistic regression.

#+begin_src R :tangle example-3-answers-b.R
print(summary(prop_odds_logistic))
print(confint(prop_odds_logistic))
#+end_src

#+begin_src 
Call:
polr(formula = support_lockdown ~ work_from_home + whisker_length + 
    trust_in_government + fifth_generation, data = data_df)

Coefficients:
                        Value Std. Error t value
work_from_homeTRUE    0.36137     0.1468  2.4616
