#+title: Applied Analytic Statistics

The notebooks in this repository are being written for use in the course Applied
Analytic Statistics. Each of the directories, =example-<n>= contains two
notebooks: =example-<n>-questions.ipynb= and =example-<n>-answers.ipynb=. The
/questions/ notebook contains the questions for the practical sessions and the
/answers/ one has partial answers. Please give the questions a solid attempt
before looking at the answers as this is the best way to check that you really
understand them.

* Contents

** Notebooks

- [[https://github.com/aezarebski/aas-extended-examples/tree/main/example-0][Example 0]] contains an overview of the software packages we will be using and
  basic python skills (primarily plotting with =matplotlib=).
- [[https://github.com/aezarebski/aas-extended-examples/tree/main/example-1][Example 1]] reviews the central limit theorem and looks at confidence intervals
  and hypothesis tests.
- [[https://github.com/aezarebski/aas-extended-examples/tree/main/example-2][Example 2]] reviews simple linear regression.
- [[https://github.com/aezarebski/aas-extended-examples/tree/main/example-3][Example 3]] reviews multiple linear regression.
- [[https://github.com/aezarebski/aas-extended-examples/tree/main/example-4][Example 4]] reviews hypothesis tests for contingency tables.
- [[https://github.com/aezarebski/aas-extended-examples/tree/main/example-5][Example 5]] reviews logisic regression.
- [[https://github.com/aezarebski/aas-extended-examples/tree/main/example-6][Example 6]] reviews mult-level models.

** Miscellaneous

- The [[https://github.com/aezarebski/aas-extended-examples/blob/main/setup.org][setup]] page gives some instructions for setting up the software and
  notebooks.
- The [[https://github.com/aezarebski/aas-extended-examples/blob/main/additional-resources.org][additional resources]] page gives some pointers to additional resources
