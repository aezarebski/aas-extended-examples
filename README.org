* Applied Analytic Statistics

The notebooks in this repository are being written for use in the course Applied
Analytic Statistics. Each of the directories, =example-<n>= contains two
notesbooks: =example-<n>-questions.ipynb= and =example-<n>-answers.ipynb=. The
/questions/ notebook contains the questions for the practical sessions and the
/answers/ one has partial answers. Please give the questions a solid attempt
before looking at the answers. For some examples there is a
=example-<n>-data.ipynb= which contains code to simulate data for those examples
which make use of simulated data.

** Jupyter Lab

The =shell.nix= file describes a package for running the notebooks in this
repository. To activate the notebook server run the following command.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
nix-shell --command "jupyter lab" 
#+END_SRC

To keep the notebooks in a neat state, please restart the kernel and run all
cells prior to commiting any changes.

** Useful links

In addition to the [[https://socialsciences.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Books/Applied-Regression-3E/index.html][course text book]] the following links may be useful to help
you complete the example notebooks.

- [[https://python.swaroopch.com/][A Byte of Python]] was the book I learnt Python from and is what I would
  recommend to most people new to programming.
- The [[https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/index.html][Example Gallery]] for Altair is very useful as a starting point for custom
  visualisations.
